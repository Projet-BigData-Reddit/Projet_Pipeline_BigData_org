What's more important is it's utility as an SoV, in an inflationary area where we might be seeing a debasement of the USD, Bitcoin is extremely important as an alternative means of storing and retaining value. \n\nAnd that's completely within the scope and ethos of Bitcoin emerging out of the 2008 crisis, imo this one will be longer and more deeply felt. Fwiw, I've been around since 2011, and I think Bitcoin is doing great as is, the uptake of technology will always adapt to the people using it (and in this sense it really doesn't matter what the fuck Satoshi would think), holding onto an ideological abstract of what something was or could be is just falling into a emotional trap.",

This is the bullrun. Previously, people would take BTC profits and pump up larger cap alts, take those profits and go to small caps and finally micro caps. More people are holding onto their BTC. Look at the charts, theres far fewer flash crashes. All metrics suggest this including BTC in cold storage and more inactive wallets than ever. This BTC progression in previous cycles saw the alt coin market going nuts. At this point, You could do a 4x on any random binance pair. The fomo was crazy. There's none of that now. Just bleeding alts to BTC.*\n\n> *\"But meme coins are stupid and serve no purpose, I only buy \"serious\" projects.*\n\n> *News flash. The alt coin you've been holding for 5 years is just as useless as ElonBadgerCoq on trader Joe's.* It's done nothing. The team has accomplished nothing. ...*I don't care how many transactions it can do or the speed of finality or what company is rumored to have plans to use it. Its the same meme coin hype shit, just a smaller scale.*\n\n> ..most of the alts you're buying and holding with the expectation of past price action will not return to ATHs. Price aside, whatever goals on your teams roadmap mean fuck all. There's not that many problems a speculative token fueled blockchain can fix that some traditional network can't do better, faster and cheaper.

Doing it this way, your Bitcoin portfolio value in dollars will always continue to grow as you keep selling very small chunks for income. \n\nGood luck, brother.",

    "text": "Yeah—the volatility index is basically on a constant trend downwards so you could argue that the lending market might be more akin to the property market longer-term. That said, Bitcoin hasn't yet gone through a financial crisis akin to 2008 as yet—and I that there's a good chance that we are probably in the beginning of a longer, more drawn out version. And in a black swan event scenario your LTV needs a big buffer—hence why I think it doesn't make sense to do this if you aren't hedged elsewhere with accessible capital. \n\nAnd to be quite honest, as someone who has a reasonable amount of wealth accumulated through crypto, the most rational decision over time is to de-risk into other assets rather than doubling down into Bitcoin holdings. ie I'm someone that could afford the risk, but it doesn't really make sense to do so, and conversely someone with a limited amount of BTC might think it's an attractive strategy but they won't have a risk profile to do so confidently.",

The key though is finding the cycles within the markets that pump.

Everybody wanted regulations removed out of the crypto industry so they could make tons of money. Just my opinion but Trump will allow his boys to rip the nose off of average and leveraged investors. The markets are nothing more than legalized gambling now and you have to keep your head on a swivel. I wish you guys the best but Trump will ultimately destroy the crypto industry because that’s what he does. Once the market has absolutely no trust and too much volatility, people will get destroyed financially.",

I knew I was running behind and had to play hardcore catch-up. \n\nFor the past 2.5 years I’ve been using my “main job for all my bills, living money, essentials, etc., and my other full time job goes 100% into Bitcoin. \n\nI actually started buying in 2019 when it was at $5,000 per coin, but didn’t understand it enough yet. I was buying it to use on the dark web. Once I began to realize what it really was, it was game on.\n\nI am 100% a Bitcoin maxi, and I believe this is the escape hatch for people to break out of the unfair financial system we’ve been forced into. I buy the dips. I buy at all time highs. I buy everything in between. I have no number in my head that I need to reach so I can stop buying. I will buy indefinitely until one day down the road, I need it for something. Like early retirement. Generational wealth to hand down to my kids. \n\nI love this post’s message: Buy Bitcoin.\nIt’s that fucking simple.",

    "text": "I don't know if Bitcoin's cycle is still valid, but there is a possibility that the price will decline from the end of this year or early next year. My advice is to do DCA from now on. I don't know which broker to use, but if you start with 10 euros per day, it won't be a big burden. When the bear market begins next year, I would like to raise the amount to 20 euros per day or wait and purchase an additional 0.1 at a good time. For your information, I live in Germany and have been doing DCA consistently since last year. Currently, most of our financial assets are invested in crypto. I have no intention of selling Bitcoin for at least 5-10 years.",
