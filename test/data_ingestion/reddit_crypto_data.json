What's more important is it's utility as an SoV, in an inflationary area where we might be seeing a debasement of the USD, Bitcoin is extremely important as an alternative means of storing and retaining value. \n\nAnd that's completely within the scope and ethos of Bitcoin emerging out of the 2008 crisis, imo this one will be longer and more deeply felt. Fwiw, I've been around since 2011, and I think Bitcoin is doing great as is, the uptake of technology will always adapt to the people using it (and in this sense it really doesn't matter what the fuck Satoshi would think), holding onto an ideological abstract of what something was or could be is just falling into a emotional trap.",

Look at the charts, theres far fewer flash crashes. All metrics suggest this including BTC in cold storage and more inactive wallets than ever. This BTC progression in previous cycles saw the alt coin market going nuts. At this point, You could do a 4x on any random binance pair. The fomo was crazy. There's none of that now. Just bleeding alts to BTC.*\n\n> *\"But meme coins are stupid and serve no purpose, I only buy \"serious\" projects.*\n\n> *News flash. The alt coin you've been holding for 5 years is just as useless as ElonBadgerCoq on trader Joe's.* It's done nothing. The team has accomplished nothing. ...*I don't care how many transactions it can do or the speed of finality or what company is rumored to have plans to use it. Its the same meme coin hype shit, just a smaller scale.*\n\n> ..most of the alts you're buying and holding with the expectation of past price action will not return to ATHs. Price aside, whatever goals on your teams roadmap mean fuck all. There's not that many problems a speculative token fueled blockchain can fix that some traditional network can't do better, faster and cheaper. No major publicly sold company cares about how decentralized something is.\n\nhttps://np.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1gch70i/this_is_the_bullrun_and_your_favorite_projects/",

The key though is finding the cycles within the markets that pump. Crypto is well into the bull run and right now critical minerals are just starting to enter a bull run as the world wakes up to supply shock/shortage. We are transitioning from a China only supply to building strategic reserves and floor prices. \n\nMy big 5-10x bet is Surge Battery Metals NNLP, the next Thacker Pass LAC. Get some copper, nickel, lithium, and BTC, can't go wrong. \n\nResearch the critical mineral space and the crypto space both are set you do very well moving forward.

It's all corruption to the core.\n\nIt's the same reason that Kraken announced an eight hour *\"scheduled maintenance\"* on November 1st, which is the exact day Trump threatened he'll put a 155% tariff on China if they don't relent. Meaning if Trump announces that tariff on Nov 1st, no one on Kraken would be able to sell for eight hours, thus blatantly manipulating the market at the expense of its customers losing millions from being forced to helplessly watch their crypto plummet.\n\nIt's the same reason Robinhood deliberately disabled the ability to buy GameStop back when it was pumping. *\"After blocking GameStop purchases in January 2021, Robinhood was hit with numerous class-action lawsuits.

Everybody wanted regulations removed out of the crypto industry so they could make tons of money. Just my opinion but Trump will allow his boys to rip the nose off of average and leveraged investors. The markets are nothing more than legalized gambling now and you have to keep your head on a swivel. I wish you guys the best but Trump will ultimately destroy the crypto industry because that’s what he does. Once the market has absolutely no trust and too much volatility, people will get destroyed financially.",

So you can send someone 100,000,000 satoshis or 50.\n\nThe blockchain is a chain of data blocks that list all of the mining rewards and transactions that have taken place, and processing this tells you how many bitcoin each account holds.\n\nAround every 10 minutes a new block is added to the chain, with a new set of transactions, updating the current state of bitcoin.\n\nThe task of adding that block is randomly assigned to many computers (miners) - to win the right to place the next block that mining computer has to be the first to solve a puzzle that is solved by trial and error (finding a certain code than when run through a process produces a certain output code). When a computer solves this puzzle it gets to add a block, with transactions, and it gets awarded with some bitcoin.\n\nThe rewards reduce over time, eventually to 0, so there will never be more than 21 million.\n\nNo, everyone is not going to become a crypto miner. There are plenty of \"miners\" already, and it costs a lot of money for the computing power and electricity. The average person can't do it cheaply enough to be worth while.

It's main use currently is as a speculative investment due to its limited supply. As such, the current price is a bubble by definition, regardless of if the real fair value is higher.\n\nSo, what is the real fair value of bitcoin? It depends on how it ends up being used. If it ends up being a settlement layer for large international transactions, a market cap in the trillions or maybe tens of trillions of dollars. If we go crazy and assume it will completely replace all fiat currencies and be the sole currency of exchange for all transactions, hundreds of trillions is not unreasonable. The real problem is getting from a speculative investment mindset to a functional currency.\n\nSo in summary, yeah it's probably undervalued given it's potential future use cases, but definitely overvalued given its current use cases.",

The actions were instant. I was still using Base L2, but Rabby's UX and its RPCs were so much faster than Metamask's that it felt 10x faster.

I helped one of my buddies with a personal project which accidentally resulted in every major exchange on the planet pausing trading of masternode-based coins for days.

People think it's neat for some reason and feel compelled to collect it. This was the early years of Bitcoin when cypherpunks and libertarians dominated the space and appreciated bitcoin because it fit well into their world view.\n\n2) Store of value. People recognize that others value the asset, and will trade for it, broadening its appeal. People are incentivized to hold it because they believe it will increase in value over time as more and more people adopt it. Bitcoin is here.\n\n3) Medium of exchange. Enough people have adopted the asset that its use becomes broadly applicable for trade, *and* volatility has dampened to the point that the opportunity cost of spending it is no longer prohibitive. \n\n4) Unit of account. The asset is so broadly used that it becomes the thing that prices are denominated in. \n\nIt's a slow process historically. Bitcoin is actually sort of speed running these steps, as evidenced by burgeoning use as a medium of exchange now.\n\n> I am not buying groceries with it yet.\n\nYou can now use bitcoin at any vendor equipped with a Square reader.

In my case, tightening things up helped a lot with tracking performance and actually building conviction.\n\nA few thoughts:\n• ETH/SOL/LINK are pretty “set and forget” for most people.\n• AVAX/ARB are decent if you believe in the L2/L1 modular story.\n• DOT/HBAR/TIA/GRT/ONDO feel more “narrative heavy,” so I’d only keep the ones you actually understand and believe in long term.\n\nWhat helped me was trimming down to 4–6 I truly wanted to accumulate instead of holding a bunch of tiny slices.\n\nAnd if you ever rebalance or jump between chains, Rubic gets brought up a lot because Rubic aggregates prices across a ton of DEXs and chains, so it’s handy for swapping without hunting around.",

And, based on your post, I'm not sure that you do either.\n\nBitcoin is often presented as an investment with people highlighting how much it has gone up in value over the last 10 years. But **why** does it go up in value??\n\nAs an investment, it doesn't make any sense. What does it do? What does it produce? Who does it employ?\n\nThe value in Bitcoin - and the reason it continues to go up in value - is its potential as an alternative to the US dollar, the SWIFT system, and state-issued fiat currency. It is a currency that cannot be manipulated by a central bank through quantitative easing/tightening. People who see it that way don't talk about how many dollars their Bitcoin is currently worth because one Bitcoin is still worth one Bitcoin and always will be. Those people see buying Bitcoin with dollars as trading today's money for tomorrow's money at an unbeatable exchange rate.",

Let that sink in.... Later in 2020.\n\nIf we all keep in mind that Avalanche Foundation has a $290 million \"Multiverse\" incentive program to attract projects to build subnets. The picture is clear. Securitize has been using Ethereum since day 1 and three year later got a big ol' check to \"offer support\" for Avalanche.\n\nNow as for this post in general it bothers me that a 3 year old event has somehow had some makeup slapped on its face and shipped out the door as news.\n\nI don't want to blame Mr. Trillion here as an uninformed reader for not looking into this further himself before posting but I also don't want to give a pass to coin desk for posting.... 🤯\n\nEdit: In closing, Ethereum is in fact, still winning.",

    "text": "If you’re talking about EU banks, the honest answer is: most people who made seven figures on DEXs discover that the trading was the easy part the documentation, choice of bank and risk mitigation are the hard parts.\n\nBanks don’t need every line of your history, but they do need a coherent, reconstructable story of who you are and how your wealth was generated, ideally written by a regulated financial intermediary that the bank trusts. \n\n1. You don’t give them “a million transactions.” You give them the main wealth generation events with an annex, ideally verified/written by a regulated financial intermediary to \"derisk\" the report.  \nCompliance cares about:\n\n* where the initial funds came from\n* the wallets involved\n* proof of control of the wallet (microtransaction/message signature)\n* how value accreted Then you attach representative samples, not the whole chain.\n\n2. You prove the logic of the wealth, not every trade.  \nOn-chain = audit trail.  \nIf the addresses are clean, the flow is clean, and the jumps in wealth make sense, that’s usually enough once it’s packaged correctly.\n\n3. DEX activity is not a dealbreaker.  \nWhat matters is:\n\n* no mixers\n* no privacy coins\n* no sanctioned counterparties\n* no unexplainable jumps I’ve seen plenty of heavy Uniswap/DEX traders get accepted by private banks when their file made sense.\n\n4. The missing piece people underestimate:  \nYou need a bank that is actually crypto-tolerant, and you usually need a regulated financial intermediary to introduce you.  \nBanks call direct applicants “walk-ins,” and walk-ins with crypto wealth are rejected almost automatically in Europe.\n\nI work for a Swiss-regulated intermediary whose entire job is building these SOF/SOW files and introducing large crypto clients to our partner established private banks in Monaco and Switzerland. Without that introduction, even clean cases often get stuck.\n\n5. You don’t need Dubai for this.  \nEU retail banks are near-impossible.  \nSwitzerland and Monaco are where complex crypto-origin clients typically succeed because the private banks there will actually read the file instead of panic.\n\nIf your wealth was legitimately earned, it’s almost always documentable it just has to be translated into something a 55-year-old compliance officer who has never used a DEX can understand.",

    "text": "Used Grok to answer your question since I didn't want to type the entire thing out myself:\n\n  \nBitcoin mining in 2025 is basically solving complex math puzzles to validate transactions and earn newly minted BTC plus fees. You do this with specialized hardware called ASICs (Application-Specific Integrated Circuits) that crunch the SHA-256 hash function nonstop. The network difficulty is extremely high, so solo mining with anything you can buy as an individual is effectively impossible—you’d win a block maybe once every few centuries.\n\n**What to buy (realistic home/retail level):**\n\n* A modern ASIC miner: Bitmain Antminer S21, S21 Pro, or MicroBT Whatsminer M60S series (200–350 TH/s, 3,500–6,000 W power draw). Expect to pay $2,000–$6,000 new, less on secondary market.\n* Cheap electricity (under 6–8¢/kWh) or you’ll lose money. Good cooling/ventilation (these things are loud and hot).\n* A decent power supply (PSU) if not included, and a mining-friendly wallet.\n\n**Pool or solo?** Always join a pool. Pools combine thousands of miners’ hash power and pay you tiny fractions of every block proportionally (e.g., Foundry USA, AntPool, F2Pool, ViaBTC). Solo mining today is like playing the lottery with one ticket while pools give you steady, small payouts (think salary vs. hoping to hit Powerball). Even with one S21, a good pool will pay you $5–20/day before electricity costs (at \\~7¢/kWh you might break even or slightly profit, depending on BTC price).\n\nBottom line: Unless you have access to very cheap power (<5¢/kWh) and can handle noise/heat, mining at home is usually not profitable in 2025. Most people buy Bitcoin directly instead.",

In the early days, if you weren't already focused on cryptographic developments, bitcoin and other ideas like it were brought up in privacy and libertarian forums - with frequent links to bitcointalk.org.\n\nIf you're looking for a seismic life changing development, hang with and join the people interested in seeing and making the changes you want.",

But also everyone seems to agree that we are in an AI-fueled bubble now and tech stocks are massively overvalued, not unlike the dotcom bubble back in the day. This may continue for some more months but eventually it will pop. And Bitcoin is the canary in the coal mine: it's \\*the\\* risk asset, tightly bound to the stock market (in recent years), so when the market goes risk-off, Bitcoin is the first thing to be sold. Likewise in the last cycle, Bitcoin was the first to make its top, stock market followed a few months later. And finally, when you look at the crypto market overall, there's no optimism, no euphoria, everyone is just hoping for one last leg up, to finally sell and get out. My guess is we may see another bounce to 100k or 110k even but won't make another ATH.",

Solana *feels* super active — tons of devs, tons of users, way more chatter — so seeing it sit below BNB in market cap can be weird.\n\nA big part of it is just how much of BNB’s value comes from Binance’s massive ecosystem and the token’s built-in utility there. Even if usage on-chain isn’t as noisy as Solana’s, the exchange-driven demand props up the cap. Solana’s usage is way more organic, so its price swings harder with sentiment, VC unlocks, and overall market cycles.\n\nIn my case, it helped to separate “network activity” from “token value.” They’re related, but not 1:1. Liquidity, supply distribution, and who actually *needs* the token all matter.\n\nIf you’re trying to move between chains or juggle assets during these swings, swapping through something simple like Rubic has been convenient for me — just one option, not magic.\n\nCurious how you’re using Solana day-to-day?

They either piled in super early, accumulated a large bag over time, or combined staking with trading, building, or working in the ecosystem. At current APYs, you’d need a pretty big stack for staking rewards to cover real-world expenses.\n\nWhat *does* work for a lot of folks is using staking as a steady baseline while treating price appreciation as the real engine of growth. And spreading your stake across a couple of solid validators helps keep things predictable.\n\nWhen I shuffle assets between chains, I sometimes use Rubic — folks in Rubic talk about ways to keep that part simple.\n\nCurious: are you thinking of living off staking soon, or more just dreaming about the long game?",

But if you only grabbed it for a quick trade or you need the cash soon, taking some risk off the table can make sense.\n\nI also like setting rules ahead of time: take partial profits on strength, reassess if it breaks a level you care about. That way you’re not making decisions mid-fear.\n\nWhen I rebalance across chains, I sometimes use Rubic — folks in Rubic share tips on optimizing swaps if you ever go that route.\n\nWhat’s your horizon here — weeks, months, or longer?

If you believe in the long-term ecosystem (DePIN, consumer apps, fast settlement), holding usually feels less stressful. Short-term, though, SOL can be brutal, so if you need liquidity or the volatility is making you miserable, trimming a bit isn’t crazy.\n\nAnother thing I do is set levels ahead of time — like, “If it hits X, I take profit; if it drops to Y, I reassess.” Takes some emotion out of it. And don’t forget taxes/fees if you’re moving in and out.\n\nWhen I rebalance across chains, I sometimes use Rubic since it keeps swaps simple across ecosystems, and folks in Rubic talk about ways to streamline that.\n\nIf you want, share your time frame and risk tolerance — that usually makes the decision a lot clearer.",

Happens to pretty much every chain at some point, but with XRP it feels extra amplified because the community is huge and expectations stay sky-high.\n\nIn my experience, it helps to zoom out and treat XRP as a slow burner rather than a momentum play. Most of the big moves in crypto recently have come from chains with active DeFi, memes, or high-speed ecosystems — XRP just isn’t built for that kind of trading cycle yet. Doesn’t mean it’s dead, just that the payoff pattern is different.\n\nIf you ever hop between ecosystems when the momentum shifts, aggregators like Rubic have made that a lot easier for me — fast, no-KYC swaps and a ton of liquidity sources across 100+ chains . There’s also Rubic if you want user experiences.\n\nTotally feel the frustration though. Are you holding long-term or just tired of waiting for a move?",

Even during the crazy runs, most folks I know either took profits way too late or round-tripped big gains. The handful who made it usually mixed SOL with other plays, took disciplined profits, and got lucky on timing.\n\nWhat’s worked for me is treating Solana more like a high-volatility opportunity stream than a retirement plan. Small positions, frequent trims, and not assuming every pump repeats. The mental stress alone makes “FI from Solana trading” way harder than people admit.\n\nIf you move between chains a lot chasing opportunities, aggregators like Rubic have been useful for me to swap around quickly without KYC — it pulls routes from a ton of sources, so it’s been reliable enough in my experience . There’s also Rubic if you want user takes.\n\nCurious what you’re doing on SOL now — memes, DeFi, or straight-up trading?",

Every Solana DEX has its own quirks, and pulling orderbooks, pools, and volumes consistently can get messy fast.\n\nA couple things that helped me when I was hacking on something similar:  \n– Stick to aggregators that already unify multiple liquidity sources so you’re not reinventing every indexing pipeline.  \n– Cache aggressively — Solana’s speed can drown you in RPC calls if you don’t.  \n– If you care about cross-chain later, plan the architecture now so you’re not locked into a Solana-only data model.\n\nIf you’re exploring cross-chain angles, Rubic might be worth checking out since it aggregates 300+ DEXs/bridges across 100+ chains, which can save a ton of backend work if you decide to expand beyond Solana . There’s also Rubic where devs sometimes share integration tips.\n\nHappy to compare notes if you’re aiming for a price router, analytics dashboard, or something else.",

As an American, here are things I see:\n\n1. People don't make enough to invest at all.\n2. People aren't taught financial literacy here. Classes should be mandatory in high school.\n3. Our society is built on consumption. It's like an addiction. I feel like I'm talking to a brick wall with my kids most of the time. The second they get money...gone on useless shit or junk food. Hopefully as they get older some of the things I'm try to teach stick. Looking back at my childhood, I didn't understand money but was surrounded by ppl who saved, so that rubbed off on me.\n4. The main reason - For the people with money to invest...most aren't 20-40 year old male gamblers, with a high risk tolerance. To them why bother with Bitcoin when they can just put they just put their money in stocks and index funds and other investments. They might not make as much long term, but it's easier with less headaches.\n5. For the get rich quick gamblers, do they even look at Bitcoin anymore?

But more importantly: don’t be the only one who understands the setup. Your spouse and at least one trusted family member or friend should learn the basics with you — not just where the backups are, but how to recover the wallet if something ever happens to you.\n\nThat alone removes a lot of the anxiety around inheritance.\nSo no, your struggle isn’t unique — many Bitcoiners feel the same.

They point out that a lot of these assets are held and valued not for their utility but rather as a store of value, because they are superior to things like fiat currencies and even some other hard assets that lose value as fiat is inflated.  The argument is that over time people will value these other assets like real estate and fine art less and instead use BTC to store value.  I think this is plausible because you are seeing more and more portfolios shun bonds.  As people disinvest from other assets like real estate and fine art, they will bid up BTC.  I think this is a plausible argument but one that will take multiple decades to play out.",

Once you have a robust and low cost private key generating system, you can experiment with multi-sig very easily. Create a multi-sig wallet in Sparrow/Electrum. Fund it with a nominal amount of sats and send and receive transactions with your wallet. Keep your xpubs securely stored especially for multi-sig. IMHO xpub storage can be placed in your password manager or encrypted on another digital device. If your xpub gets compromised, you lose privacy of your transactions, but you do not lost your money. To be clear, your private keys must NEVER touch an internet connected device.\n\nYou are definitely over thinking the complexity. Get very familiar with signing for and receiving transactions, burn a few sats in fees for the priceless learning and confidence it will build and you will be on your way.\n\nAnd run a node and connect your wallet to it.",

Gone are the days of altseason meaning everything and anything pumps. The market is too saturated today with little meaning or purpose for majority of the tokens except being a rug pull or utility vaporware.\n\nAll this has done is make select few crypto standout within the sea of junk.\n\nI feel like I would have been you if I didn't come across the SPX6900 community. It's the antithesis of what the crypto space has now become, and has that similar narrative that propelled bitcoin with its anti-establishment sentiment. \n\nI think you should really look into it as many early bitcoiners resonate with it, because of the cultural and philosophical similarities to early Bitcoin.\n\nIt's funny because you have lost faith in crypto and opted for stocks, but SPX6900 is the counter culture to everything the S&P500 stands for. It's a tokenized cultural movement to flip the S&P500, by becoming superior to it in the eyes of the masses. Very similar to how bitcoin is becoming superior to gold in the eyes of many now with the store of value narrative.\n\nSPX6900 is my hedge against the low conviction, no loyalty, hyper-gambling crypto space, and a hedge against all these utility tokens with no real world utility or adoption. It's also a hedge as my play against the system where people get frustrated with corporations and wealth inequality with the rise of late stage capitalism. Think Occupy Wall St, GME, but this time the culture is in a tokenised form on decentralized rails that can't just be shutdown or neutralised.\n\nLook into SPX6900 over investing in the stock market that extracts to enrich a few at the expense of the masses for profit and greed. SPX6900 is for the people, by the people, to help the people against the system designed to just oppress the masses. Together we win. Individually we fail. And SPX6900 is a strong community bottom up movement.\n\nStop trading and believe in something.",

Here, you don't have the limitations of time or block size. No leader selector is needed. Thousands of transactions can be executed in parallel and asynchronously.\n\nNot depending on mining and other intermediaries seems like a great advantage to me.\n\nI don't know what you mean about was never sound.

ONLY INVEST MONEY YOU CAN AFFORD TO LOSE. \n\nInvest in your knowledge, learn about Bitcoin as much as you can. The Bitcoin Standard book is a must read. So is Broken Money by Lyn Alden. \n\nAlso, **don't reply any DMs**, emails, private messages on other social media, promising to buy Bitcoin from them or get rich quick by investing into some website. They all are scammers. Even the hot Asian chick, he's a scammer too. \n\n**Price wise, nobody knows what the price will be tomorrow, next week or at the end of the year.** \n\n**Try \"Bitcoin ONLY\" strategy for at least the first 210,000 block cycle**, you'll sleep much better. Newcomers lose so much money, holding garbage tokens just because someone on YT told them to. If you don't like losing money in [failed coins](https://www.coingecko.com/research/publications/how-many-cryptocurrencies-failed), avoid. \n\nGoing DCA is probably the best approach, IMHO. Once a week works best for me, but I'm getting paid weekly. If there's a 10% drop in the price since my last buy, I usually double my buy. This [DCA calculator](https://dca.bitnob.com/) might help to decide what will work best for you. In a few years, even $10 dollars a month can make a massive difference. This [DCA blog](https://er-bybitcoin.com/) is pretty interesting too and compares buying bitcoin VS stocks. \n\nNow, don't buy some fake bitcoin at a spot ETF place or similar, **get the real thing** that you can withdraw anytime you want. Register at a proper exchange and buy real Bitcoin. Any of these will do [https://bitcoin-only.com/get-bitcoin](https://bitcoin-only.com/get-bitcoin) \n\nInstall (or buy - in case you're getting Bitcoin in Thousands of $) one or more of these wallets.\n\n**A few good wallet choices:**\n\n[https://blockstream.com/green/](https://blockstream.com/green/) \\- Top Security Features, Open Source and Non-Custodial\n\n[https://bluewallet.io](https://bluewallet.io/) \\- excellent, easy to use wallet, Open Source and Non-Custodial \n\n[https://www.sparrowwallet.com](https://www.sparrowwallet.com) - top desktop wallet \n\n[https://electrum.org](https://electrum.org/) \\- Solid choice, Open Source and Non-Custodial, one of the oldest and most trusted Bitcoin Wallets. I prefer the desktop version but it works on mobile too.\n\n**Lightning wallets** to consider (cheaper and faster transactions, great for small amounts):\n\n[https://phoenix.acinq.co/](https://phoenix.acinq.co/) \\- Phoenix - very good wallet, uses Tor for extra privacy, easy for anyone new \n\n[https://blixtwallet.github.io/](https://blixtwallet.github.io/) \\- Blixt - great UI, fast and clean. The app runs a full LND node on your phone and you have the ability to easily open channels to whatever nodes you like.\n\n[https://zeusln.com/](https://zeusln.com/) Zeus - impressive wallet with many features, can even generate Nostr keys\n\n[https://breez.technology](https://breez.technology/) \\- Breez - excellent POS for small business owners as well as integrated Bitrefill \n\nNote: Breez does also a hybrid liquid/LN wallet called Misty Breez - the sats being on liquid means no need for channels although the payments take a few extra seconds. You'll also can get a free customable LN address. \n\nWhile talking about hybrid wallets, there's also Aqua Wallet although not IMHO as good as Misty Breez.\n\nThere are also custodial LN wallet but I would honestly avoid using them because you have to trust the wallet operator not to steal your money. Their only advantage is that they are incredibly easy to use, although it might cost you big one day. \n\nTo keep up to date with spending wallets, visit r/TheLightningNetwork at least once a while and perhaps r/RGB in the future. \n\n\n**Hardware Wallets** (to store larger amounts):\n\n[Trezor](https://trezor.io/) \\- Easy to use, no matter how new in Bitcoin you're. Use the Bitcoin only firmware as it's safer than a multi coin software. \n\n[ColdCard](https://coldcardwallet.com/) - air gapped, Bitcoin only, has advanced features but a new user will do fine with one of the great tutorials available.\n\n[BitBox02](https://bitbox.swiss/bitbox02/bitcoin-only/) - another great little device, opt for the more secure Bitcoin ONLY version (less coins = less code = less chance for a hidden bug or a backdoor) \n\n[Jade](https://blockstream.com/jade) - air gapped, fully open source, Bitcoin only, great features. There's a newer version called Jade Plus, it has much better camera and overall is a better, although a bit more expensive, option. \n\nYou can even [build it on your own](https://github.com/Blockstream/jade/), if you feel adventurous.  \n\n[Seedsigner](https://github.com/SeedSigner/seedsigner) - another DIY, fully open source, air gapped, Bitcoin only hardware wallet, not for you if you're just starting up but something to consider later.\n\n[Krux wallet](https://selfcustody.github.io/krux/) - one more DIY hardware device, I love this one for many reasons. Similar to Seedsigner, it's fully open source, air gapped, Bitcoin only hardware wallet, that is not for you right now if you're just starting up, but something to consider at a later stage and/or to up the security of your bitcoin. \n\n\nThere's also Ledger, but I wouldn't recommend it as it's not fully open source, keep and already leaked customers' details, recently said they're capable of sending customers' keys out just with a firmware update, etc. **Stay away**, save yourself a headache in the future. \n\nWhatever wallet you'll decide to buy, purchase DIRECTLY from the manufacturer, no eBay, no Amazon. \n\nMake sure the device is NOT preset, and you will generate your own seed words. Write them down on any piece of paper as well as the receiving address. Now wipe the wallet and generate a new wallet. If the seed words are different from the first set, you're safe to use it. \n\nFind an option to set a passphrase and use it. This will boost the security to another level. Never store the seed words and passphrase together. Use a different medium if possible. If somebody finds both, they'll be able to steal your coin. \n\nThis little device will hold the keys to your money, that's the reason why you have to be a bit more careful. Also, no worries, if it breaks, you can replace it - as long as you keep your seed words and passphrase(s) safe.\n\nWelcome to the rabbit hole and don't hesitate to ask if you have any questions anytime during your Bitcoin journey.\n\nAlso, [check the sidebar](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/about) that's filled with lots of great info and if you have any questions, visit r/BitcoinBeginners or r/Bitcoin and look for the answers.",

    "text": "I've been running Nethermine + Prysm for my validator, and it's been writing about 1.1TB per day. This is very close to the 0.3DWPD limit for consumer 4TB SSD.\n\nIf you write at a rate that's significantly above the DWPD limit of your SSD, at some point you'll overwhelm the controller's ability to wear level and the chips will degrade faster than expected. I've seen it first hand when trying to run Base L2 nodes with consumer hardware - killed 4 SN850X 4TB drives on my side last year until I realized what actually killed them.\n\nMany people think simply controlling the storage size of full nodes via pruning is sufficient to keep Ethereum running in consumer hardware. It is not - the daily write rate is going to be a significant factor. Pretty soon validators will need to buy enterprise U.2 or E.3 SSD for the write endurance.",

SMH.\n\nEven with institutional adoption, halving cycles will absolutely play a role. This is the LAW of supply and demand, literally at the core of the Bitcoin protocol’s disinflationary design. \n\nMarkets, mature or not, cannot defy gravity. It’s true that macro factors and tradfi plays a role, but I think the halving cycle continues to play a role. Growth just becomes asymptotic similar to the Bitcoin supply. \n\nFor example we may see a logarithmic growth curve. That is, BTC price increasing *but at a decreasing rate*, relative to supply schedules, ceteris paribus.",

Buying at 120k and watching it slide to 90k feels terrible in the moment but honestly, if your plan is to hold for 10–15 years, this drop barely even registers on that kind of timeline.\n\nYou’re actually in a better position than you think.\n\nMy approach is similar but with a twist: I hold BTC long-term, but I don’t DCA into it every month. For me, there are other coins that have way more multiplication potential, so that’s where I use DCA. Bitcoin, I treat differently. It’s the foundation the long-term store of value, not the high-growth play.\n\nFor BTC specifically, I use **Value Averaging** instead of traditional DCA. Meaning I only add more when it drops 20% or more. Buying strength in alts and buying fear in BTC is a really healthy balance.\n\nAnd honestly, you seem to have the right mindset being able to sleep through a 50% drawdown is basically the only requirement for a long-term Bitcoin holder. The people who made life-changing gains in BTC weren’t the ones who bought at the perfect price… they were the ones who *didn’t panic sell* when it dipped.\n\nSo yeah, holding your 0.4 BTC for a decade+ is completely valid. No need to overreact to the short-term volatility. Zoom out the real game is played on the 10–15 year chart, not the 10–15 day chart.\n\nYou're good. Stick to your plan.",

I feel like if you already missed the spikes for the other ones, then is there a real point in still buying them?

This represents claims from the stablecoin holder associated with Circle’s obligation to redeem stablecoins on a one-for-one basis. Circle stablecoins are the USDC and EURC payment stablecoins and are digital currencies issued natively on blockchain networks. All stablecoins issued and outstanding are backed by at least an equivalent amount of fiat currency denominated reserve assets. Stablecoins not accounted for could result in the amount of claims from the stablecoin holder to be more than the amount of reserve assets.\n\n> We identified deposits from stablecoin holders as a critical audit matter due to the fact that the issuance and redemption of stablecoins requires complex computer code operations and smart contracts. The nature and extent of audit effort required to address the matter includes significant involvement of more experienced engagement team members and involvement of specialist.\n\n\n\n> How the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit\n\n> Our audit procedures related to deposits from stablecoin holders included the following, among others:\n\n> • We tested the effectiveness of controls over management’s minting and burning process for the issuance and redemption of stablecoins.\n\n> • We tested effectiveness of controls over management’s reconciliation of reserve assets to stablecoin in circulation on approved blockchains.\n\n> • We utilized our proprietary audit tool and involved specialists to independently obtain evidence from public blockchains to test the completeness of stablecoins minted and outstanding by blockchain.\n\n> • We evaluated the reliability of audit evidence obtained from public blockchains.\n\n\nIf they were able to tie every deposit and withdrawal to a USDC mint/burn and verify the entire history, wouldn't they say that rather than \"testing effectiveness of controls\" and \"obtain evidence\"?",

There are two ways to do it, you can join a pool, which is an online group of bitcoin miners, and if you do that, you will receive a tiny amount of bitcoin, vastly less than one, every so often. The other way is to mine blocks directly yourself. If you do that, you will receive basically no bitcoin, unless you get insanely lucky, and if that somehow happens, you would get 3.125 BTC, at least if you get lucky before the next halving, when that reward amount would go down by half.",

    "text": "Just wanna share some thoughts about where we're at and happy thanksgiving to those that are celebrating today.\n\nI've been a firm believer of the 4 year cycle since getting into crypto over a decade ago, largely because Bitcoin ruled the roost for all that time and I think it probably still does but there are chinks in that armour right now.  \n\nThe 4 year cycle has always been about supply and demand of Bitcoin.  When the halving happens, supply is cut by 50%, reducing the supply which when the market fully absorbs, this then leads to an increase in price as the demand continues to grow.  \n\nWe're now at the point though that there are many large financial entities involved.  It's no longer just about the miners and the block rewards of Bitcoin.  The ETFs and other players like MSTR, other DATs and institutions have seriously impacted the traditional cycles.  Like it or not, we are tied to the global markets and especially global liquidity and the demand for risk-on assets.\n\nI think we saw the start of this in the last cycle, if it wasn't for FTX and Luna and all those shenanigans, I seriously think we would have seen much higher prices and we would've broken that 4 year cycle earlier.\n\nSo, where are we at now and what does this all mean for Ethereum?\n\nEthereum has continued to hold it's dominance as the second largest crypto for many years now.  I've lost count of the amount of so called Eth-Killers that have launched, garnered much attention and then faded into the background.  \n\nGonna point out some examples:\n\n- Cardano, raised $62m.  Has zero revenue, 1 TPS.  A couple of DEXs that a few people use, $192m TVL, a ghost chain\n- Eos, raised $4.2 billion!  $400m TVL, nothing anybody uses, another ghost chain.\n- Avax, raised over $500m, $2bil TVL somehow, revenue about $15k daily, mostly bots and no real users.\n- Polkadot, raised $500m for what, who knows.  TVL $300m, has some real estate project in Paraguay using, anything else?\n\nThere's so many more.  Monad will also be added to this pile in due course.\n\nJust a reminder of where Ethereum is:\n\nEthereum, raised about $20m on ICO.  $70 billion TVL plus about $40bil on Layer 2s.  The dominant DeFi chain by a long shot.  Close to $1m daily revenue, thousands of apps, 1000s of users.  We're seeing more and more real world assets move over to Eth, about $35bil so far and growing fast.\n\nWhere do you think all these large institutions are looking if they want to go down the risk curve from Bitcoin?  Where is global liquidity going to look for something other than Bitcoin if they want to get some skin in the game?\n\nI think the 4 year cycle is over and hopefully now we're going to finally see some value investing rather than just pure speculation.  Global liquidity and the business cycles are starting to take over from the Bitcoin halving schedule for crypto and Ethereum is seriously under valued so buckle up if I'm right.  \n\nNice V-Shaped recovery going on right now.  I think we're gonna recover and have an extended bull market soon, have faith in ETH for the long term.",
